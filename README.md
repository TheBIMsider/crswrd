**Build it. Solve it.**

CRSWRD is a lightweight, browser-based crossword generator and solver.
You choose the difficulty, theme, tone, and grid size. CRSWRD builds the puzzle. You solve it.

No accounts. No installs. Just puzzles.

## What this is

- A crossword generator and solver
- Fully client-side (no servers, no accounts)
- Built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Designed to be fast, simple, and replayable

---

## What this is not

- Not a daily crossword
- Not competitive or scored
- No puzzle saving or resume (yet) — preferences are remembered, puzzles are not
- No guarantee every generated puzzle is perfectly balanced (beta behavior)

## Word packs

CRSWRD includes **10** curated word packs (100 words each), plus an **Everything** mode that mixes words from all installed packs.

**Included packs:**

- General
- Movies
- Sports
- Holidays
- Animals
- Music
- Transportation
- The 80's
- The 90's
- World Events

**Everything mode:**

- “Everything” is not a separate pack.
- It randomly pulls from all installed packs, so it automatically includes future packs too.

---

## Known limitations

- Puzzle difficulty can vary due to random generation
- No puzzle saving or resume (yet)
- No zoom or pan for large grids (planned)
- Mobile works, but the best experience is still on desktop
